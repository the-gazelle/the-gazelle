# Running notes

After doing some experimentation with Obsidian, I've decided to stick with VScode for notes based on three factors:

1. I'd like to really learn VScode and get really good at all the ins and outs of navigating via the keyboard.
2. VScode markdown editing is more than adequate for the level of note taking I need [Markdown in VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown)
3. I'm not allowed to install Obsidian on my work PC

VScode profiles were another helpful tool I found when looking at how to set up VScode for Markdown. [VScode Profiles](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/profiles) They even have a doc writer template that installs a few different helpful extensions and minimizes the UI appropriately. The only change I made from the Docwriter template was keeping my settings based on the default configuration so that the styling from [Omakub](https://omakub.org/) would still apply. I then figured out that I had to install the appropriate extensions for the Omakub themes into the Docwriter profile. This is accomplished by just switching to the Docwriter profile and installing the style extensions.

Right now I'm just working on setting up my learning repo to see how the markdown files and links show up in github.
Yay!! All the links work! lol
